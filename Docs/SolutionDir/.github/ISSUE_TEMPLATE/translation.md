# 1: Introduction

XPortal changes how portals work in Valheim. This means that XPortal also changes the terminology that is used.

**Name**

XPortal gives portals a "name" instead of a "tag". Please do not use your language's equivalent of the word "tag".

**Destination**

The portal on the other side is a "destination". Please do not use the word "target" when translating into your language.

**Configure**

When a user opens the XPortal window to change the name and destination of a portal, this is called "configuring the portal". Please try to find an equivalent of the word "Configure". Do not use "Manage" or "Edit".
