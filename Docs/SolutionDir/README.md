# Bugs, Feature Requests and Translations

First of all, before you report a bug, please make sure that the problem you are experiencing is actually caused by XPortal. If you are running other mods, disable those, and see if the problem goes away. Or the other way around: disable XPortal, and see if that makes the problem go away. If you discover that XPortal is incompatible with another mod, please do report that, because I might be able to create work-arounds for that. If you are not sure, or you are struggling with these steps, then just report the problem, and we'll go from there.

It is important to me that I can make XPortal as bug-free as possible, but **please bear in mind that without your `LogOutput.log`, I will not be able to debug your issue at all**. Just showing me a screenshot of an error is not enough for me to discover the cause of that error.

To report a bug, please navigate to the [Issues page](https://github.com/SpikeHimself/XPortal/issues), click [New issue](https://github.com/SpikeHimself/XPortal/issues/new/choose), choose `Bug report`, and fill out the template.

For feature requests, choose `Feature request` on the [New issue](https://github.com/SpikeHimself/XPortal/issues/new/choose) page.

To add a translation to XPortal, choose `Translation` when submitting a [New issue](https://github.com/SpikeHimself/XPortal/issues/new/choose).


# Installation instructions (for developers)

I will soon write a guide to get XPortal working in your development environment. For now, you can probably figure some stuff out by having a look at the [JotunnModStub](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModStub) project that XPortal inherited from AnyPortal. Please bear in mind that the information there might have changed since XPortal was created, and that XPortal itself may over time have diverted from the steps laid out there. Again, a guide will follow soon!


# I did more too!

Please have a look at my other mod too! [XStorage](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/2290) lets you open multiple chests at once, rename them, and move items/stacks to the most suitable chest.
