## Installation instructions

The easiest method to install XPortal is by using a mod manager such as [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1) or [r2modman](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). You can download XPortal on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/2239) or [Thunderstore](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/SpikeHimself/XPortal/) and let your mod manager handle the rest.

If you prefer to install manually, download the latest release from one of the links mentioned above, or on [GitHub](https://github.com/SpikeHimself/XPortal/releases), and copy the contents of the `plugins` directory to `Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\plugins`, so that `XPortal.dll` and the translation directories land in `Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\plugins\XPortal\`.
