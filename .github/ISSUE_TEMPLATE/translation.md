XPortal changes how portals work in Valheim. This means that XPortal also changes the terminology that is used.

**Name**
XPortal gives portals a "name". Please do not use your language's equivalent of the word "tag" at all.

**Destination**
The portal on the other side is a "destination". Please do not use the word "target" when translating into your language.

**Configure**
When a user opens the XPortal window to change the name and destination of a portal, this is called "configuring the portal". Please try to find an equivalent of the word "Configure". Do not use "Manage" or "Edit".

**What is the name of the language you are translating to?**
Please use the English name as it is used on this page:  https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/localization/language-list.html

**Please replace the English translations in quotation marks below:**

Portal description: "Connects to another portal",
Set tag: "Configure",
Tag: "Name",
Target: "Destination",
Target `none`: "(None)",
Name `no name`: "(No name)",
XPortal UI header title: "Hail, traveller!"
